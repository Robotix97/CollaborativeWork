  <p>IoT covers a range of topics, and mainly refers to the network our devices make to interact with each other and automate menial to complex parts of our lives.</p>

<h3 class="mt-3"><span class="font-weight-bold">What is IoT?</span></h3>
<p class="mt-4">IoT affects our everyday lives without us knowing. It is a key design concept of most modern devices and allows us to
use devices without worrying about their inter-connectivity. It refers to how modern devices connect to each other in a way that humans need
not interact, improving automation and hence improving most aspects of our lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Below are some use cases of IoT, to demonstrate how we connect them in unexpected circumstances to improve our day to day lives.</p>

              <p class="card-text">
                Maintaining our devices' security is a key part of software and hardware development. Devices are designed so that there is no easy
				way to bypass security protocols or get into our devices without our permission, however, IoT does exactly that. IoT devices
				are generally low security, operating un-encrypted over WiFi or Bluetooth, allowing unauthorised users access to your transmitted data
				via use of Wireshark or other similar applications. This causes great issue with some devices e.g. security cameras which transmit photos
				over the internet unencrypted, or upload them to a website with no security to be accessed from an app. Anyone can access this information,
				and it is a great problem holding back many IoT devices.

              <h4 class="card-title">Batteries</h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                Batteries are generally large, conspicuous and heavy. This leads to many problems upon implementing IoT devices, as they need to be able
				to transmit data from anywhere, and this requires a battery. For some devices, such as phones, fitness trackers and remotes, this is less
				of an issue, due to the large nature of these devices, and the ability to replace these batteries upon requirement.
				however, with smaller devices, mainly sensors, it can be very difficult to implement
				batteries due to many reasons, for example in an agriculture scenario, the batteries would need to be incredibly durable and waterproof,
				for implementation in humidity and temperature sensors. This is hard to do and hence is causing difficulty in ensuring that IoT devices
				are cheap and easy to implement.

        <p>Agriculture is a key part of society, however many parts of it can easily be automated ensuring farmers can produce more crop each year.</p>
		<p class="modal-dialog">“Automation is cost cutting by tightening the corners and not cutting them.” – <span class="font-weight-bold">Haresh Sippy</span></p>
		<p>Each year farmers spend vast amounts of time watering crops, maintaining humidity in greenhouses and ensuring conditions are perfect for growth.
		This is time that can be ill-afforded, as their time is better spent working on the crop itself, or maintaining the machines that do so.</p>
		<p>Farmers can now use IoT devices to provide:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Precision Farming - using sensors to detect temperature and humidity, and using this information to control
		a VRI (Variable Rate Irigation) and heating system. This allows the maximum profitability to be achieved from each crop, by maintaining them in
		precisely the correct conditions.</li>
		<li>Crop Management - Drones can be used to do large scale crop management, over a whole field. This can be done via arial or ground drones,
		fit for purpose. This means the farmer can easily check on crop health, growth and many individual factors about the crop's condition. This massively
		reduces the time that the user must devote to travelling across a field daily when it can be automated by a set of devices.</li>
		<li>Livestock Management - By using a mesh of nodes (each animal), the farmer can individually distinguish each animal, and their conditions.
		This is useful as if an animal ever becomes diseased, it can be distanced from the herd/flock to maintain the good health of the rest of the livestock.
		Furthermore, data can be stored about each animal such as it's age or weight, ensuring it is in optimal health.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This massive increase in profitability through IoT and reduction in time loss to menial tasks means that a single person can now control
		a much greater area and provide more produce per crop.</p>

		<p class="modal-dialog">“The Internet will disappear. There will be so many IP addresses, so many devices, sensors, things that you are wearing,
		things that you are interacting with, that you won’t even sense it. It will be part of your presence all the time. Imagine you walk into a room,
		and the room is dynamic. And with your permission and all of that,
		you are interacting with the things going on in the room.” – <span class="font-weight-bold">Eric Schmidt</span></p>
		
		<p>Modern life has become dependant upon our inter-connectivity with each other, and the same is true for devices. Without inter-connectivity,
		many modern features we take for granted disappear, such as wireless devices.</p>
		<p>Smart devices are just another thing we are beginning to take for granted, as IoT allows for our fridges to text us when we're out of milk,
		they allow for the garage door opening from your phone leading to the heating turning on. They optimise our day to day lives and effectively
		remove insignificant tasks allowing for a greater deal of comfort as we live our lives.</p>
		<p>Smart devices are now being integrated into the clothes we wear, allowing for in built headphones and other niche products to become
		more popular and affordable, improving the efficiency of our day to day lives.</p>
