					<p>Possibly the most well-known modern-day example of computerised entertainment, video games have a long and storied history dating back decades. Their technology, both physical and digital, has changed so much as to be nigh-unrecognisable, and whole industries have risen and fallen in order to satisfy the insatiable consumer demand.</p>
					<h5><i>Spacewar!</i> (1962)</h5>
					<p>Considered the first example of a genuine computer game, <i>Spacewar!</i> was first developed in 1962 by Steve Russel (then studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) with help from a number of his peers. Although simple in its design and gameplay, its addictive nature and portable nature meant it rapidly became widespread, and proved that, with enough support, a commercial video game would one day be feasible. It is no overstatement to say that it essentially paved the way for the video game industry - an industry which, today, is one of the largest in the world. In fact, by 2022, the U.S. gaming market is forecast to reach over $230 billion in revenue, making it the single largest market in the world. Not bad for such a small start!</p>
					<h5>Arcades (19##-19##)</h5>
					<p>Unsuprisingly, the first 'arcade' game as we would understand it was a single, amateurly-produced, coin-operated machine - and the game that it played was none other than <i>Spacewar!</i>. The first mass-produced arcade machine - a game called <i>Computer Space</i> - was created later that same year (1971), and interest in the market began to snowball. With the invention and production of the world-renowned <i>Space Invaders</i> in 1978, the rush for new games began, and the world reached what is now known as the Golden Age of Arcade Games.</p>
					<p>The bubble persisted for over a decade. Even after the development and rising popularity of home consoles in the late 1980s, arcades remained a popular pasttime, and clung to relevance despite a drop in revenue from $8 billion in 1981 to just $2 billion in 1990. Multiple innovations, including motion sensor controls and 3D graphics, kept the industry afloat for multiple years, before a sudden explosion of interest (now commonly termed the Arcade Renaissance) lifted it through the mid-90s and allowed the technology to reach new heights. With titles like <i>Street Fighter</i> and <i>Mortal Kombat</i> setting gameplay precedents for decades to come, arcades were once again back in fashion.</p>
					<p>It didn't last. By 2004, improved 3D graphics, gameplay, and sound amongst home consoles meant that the total revenue of the industry was now just in the millions of dollars, and arcades today are only present in niche markets such as virtual reality, dance games, and other forms of specialised console.</p>
